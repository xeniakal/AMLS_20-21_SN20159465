## How to use

This project is part of the final assignment of AMLS 2020-2021 course of Integrated Machine Learning Systems MSc at UCL. It consists of four tasks **A1, A2, B1, B2** which are explained on [Tasks](#tasks).
The structure of project is the following:

## Tasks

Add content...
(say what .ipynb and .py do)
The assignment involves the realisation of various machine learning tasks on a provided
dataset. You are expected to go through the data, analyse it and/or pre-process
it as necessary.
all steps taken to solve the tasks, explaining your model
and design choices. In addition, in the report, you should also describe and analyse
the results obtained via your experiments and provide accuracy prediction scores on
unseen data.
You should design separate modes for each task and report training errors, validation errors,
hyper-parameter tuning. You are allowed to use the same model/methodology for different
tasks, but you must explain the reason behind choices. If you tried several models for
one task, feel free to show them in your code and compare the results in the report.

## Workflow graph

Add pipeline procedures...

## Dependencies

Add libraries...

## Code and Folders

Explain how to run...

If you have an Nvidia GPU, then you can install tensorflow-gpu package. It will make things run a lot faster.

## Final results

Add table with final accuracy results
