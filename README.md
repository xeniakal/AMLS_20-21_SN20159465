# AMLS_20-21_SN20159465

This assignment involves the realisation of various machine learning tasks on two provided datasets that are subsets of the original CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) and Cartoon Set. The datasets can be downloaded via following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wGrq9r1fECIIEnNgI8RS-_kPCf8DVv0B/view?usp=sharing. 

We went through the data, analysed it and pre-processed it as necessary. We designed separate modes for each task and report training errors, validation errors, hyper-parameter tuning. To choose the best-fitted model we tried several models for each task, as you can see in code files and compared the results through tables and plots.

## How to use

This project is part of the final assignment of AMLS 2020-2021 course of Integrated Machine Learning Systems MSc at UCL. It consists of four tasks **A1, A2, B1, B2** which are explained on [Tasks](#tasks).
The structure of project is the following:
- AMLS_20-21_SN20159465
  - A1
  - A2
  - B1
  - B2
  - Datasets
    - cartoon_set
    - celeba
    - cartoon_set_test
    - celeba_test
  - main.py
  - imports.py
  - README.md
  
 The **A1, A2, B1 and B2** folders contain the code files for each task, besides the pretrained models that had the better performance.
 
 all steps taken to solve the tasks, explaining your model
and design choices. In addition, in the report, you should also describe and analyse
the results obtained via your experiments and provide accuracy prediction scores on
unseen data.


## Tasks

Add content...
(say what .ipynb and .py do)


## Workflow graph

Add pipeline procedures...

## Dependencies

Add libraries...

## Code and Folders

Explain how to run...

If you have an Nvidia GPU, then you can install tensorflow-gpu package. It will make things run a lot faster.

## Final results

Add table with final accuracy results
